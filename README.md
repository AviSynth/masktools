### MaskTools 2 ###

This is a repo for my games with MaskTools 2. I'll list all important changes later but for now it just compiles with ICL/MSVC in VS2012 (yes this means I'm going to go full C++11, and I'll drop pre-sse2 processors compatibility if I need to). Do note that you need the vanilla yasm and not vsyasm to compile it.

Also while original masktools code is quite exceptional, mine isn't as good. Sorry about that.

Oh and I'm not much into asm so don't expect anything great on that front. Actually, don't expect anything at all.
